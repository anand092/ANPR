# ANPR
Automatic Number Plate Recognition 
Automatic number-plate recognition (ANPR; see also other names below) is a technology that uses optical character recognition on images to read vehicle registration plates to create vehicle location data. It can use existing closed-circuit television, road-rule enforcement cameras, or cameras specifically designed for the task. ANPR is used by police forces around the world for law enforcement purposes, including checking if a vehicle is registered or licensed. It is also used for electronic toll collection on pay-per-use roads and as a method of cataloguing the movements of traffic, for example by highways agencies.

Automatic number-plate recognition can be used to store the images captured by the cameras as well as the text from the license plate, with some configurable to store a photograph of the driver. Systems commonly use infrared lighting to allow the camera to take the picture at any time of day or night. ANPR technology must take into account plate variations from place to place.

Privacy issues have caused concerns about ANPR, such as government tracking citizens' movements, misidentification, high error rates, and increased government spending. Critics have described it as a form of mass surveillance.
Algorithms Used In ANPR......
Plate localization – responsible for finding and isolating the plate on the picture
Plate orientation and sizing – compensates for the skew of the plate and adjusts the dimensions to the required size
Normalization – adjusts the brightness and contrast of the image
Character segmentation – finds the individual characters on the plates
Optical character recognition
Syntactical/Geometrical analysis – check characters and positions against country-specific rules
The averaging of the recognised value over multiple fields/images to produce a more reliable or confident result, especially given that any single image may contain a reflected light flare, be partially obscured, or possess other obfuscating effects.
The complexity of each of these subsections of the program determines the accuracy of the system. During the third phase (normalization), some systems use edge detection techniques to increase the picture difference between the letters and the plate backing. A median filter may also be used to reduce the visual noise on the image.

Challenges 

Poor file resolution, usually because the plate is too far away but sometimes resulting from the use of a low-quality camera
Blurry images, particularly motion blur
Poor lighting and low contrast due to overexposure, reflection or shadows
An object obscuring (part of) the plate, quite often a tow bar, or dirt on the plate
Read license plates that are different at the front and the back because of towed trailers, campers, etc.
Vehicle lane change in the camera's angle of view during license plate reading
A different font, popular for vanity plates (some countries do not allow such plates, eliminating the problem)
Circumvention techniques
Lack of coordination between countries or states. Two cars from different countries or states can have the same number but different design of the plate.
